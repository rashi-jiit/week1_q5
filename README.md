# Calculator Program

This is a console-based calculator program written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, and factorial calculations. It also supports memory functions to store and reuse results.

# factorial(int a)
  - Purpose: Calculates the factorial of `a`.
  - Returns: The factorial of `a`.
     
# main()
  - Purpose: Handles user input, performs operations, and manages memory.
  - Variables: `a`, `b`, `r`, `memory` for calculations and memory storage; `op`, `choice` for user input.
  
# Control Flow:
  - Prompts for operation type.
  - Reads the first number (`a`).
  - Reads the operator (`op`).
  - Depending on `op`, performs the corresponding operation.
  - Displays the result (`r`).
  - Manages memory: store (`mi`), clear (`mc`), reuse result (`reuse`), reuse memory (`mr`), restart, or quit.

# Usage
- Start: Enter a number and an operator.
- Operations: Supported operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `!`.
- Result: View the result.
- Memory: `mi` to store, `mc` to clear.
- Control: `restart`, `reuse`, `mr`, `quit`.

Enjoy!
